    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, BLOB\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "The Primary Key is a columns or set of columns with unique value, where the Foreign Key is a colun or a set of columns in one table that references the Primary Key columns in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "One to one, one to many, and many to many.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",

    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "LEFT JOIN- returns all records from table A (left table) and the matching record from table B (right table). If there is no match in the right table the result is NULL.\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN- returns all records from table B (right table) and the matching record from table A (left table). if there is no match in the left table the result is NULL.\n",
    "INNER JOIN- default. It is the intersection between two tables.\n",
    "OUTER JOIN- It is not suported by sqlite.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "The GROUP BY statements groups rows that have the same values into summary rows. It can be used with Aggregate functions to group the results by one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Associative Entities maps two or more table together and resolves many-to-many JOINs relationships.\n",
    "\n",
